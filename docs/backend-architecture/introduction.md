# Introduction

This document outlines the backend architecture for the Employee Lifecycle Management System, including API design, database schema, service architecture, and deployment strategy. Its primary goal is to serve as the guiding architectural blueprint for AI-driven backend development, ensuring consistency and adherence to chosen patterns and technologies.

**Relationship to Frontend Architecture:**
This document works in conjunction with the Frontend Architecture Document (`docs/ui-architecture.md`) which defines the React + TypeScript frontend using Vite, Material-UI, and React Query. The backend architecture detailed here provides the REST API and data services consumed by that frontend.

**Core System Purpose:**
The backend supports a workflow orchestration platform that automates employee onboarding and offboarding processes. It must handle:
- Workflow template management (drag-and-drop designer support)
- Dynamic task routing based on roles and departments
- Mandatory verification checklists
- Complete audit trails
- Email notifications via Outlook/SMTP integration
- Role-based access control (HR Admin, Manager, Tech Support, Finance)

## Starter Template Decision

**Backend Framework:** Spring Boot 3.x with Java 17+

**Rationale (from PRD NFR17):**
- Enterprise-grade Java framework with proven reliability
- Spring ecosystem provides comprehensive solutions (Security, Data JPA, Mail)
- Strong type safety and compile-time error detection
- Excellent ORM with Spring Data JPA and Hibernate
- Built-in dependency injection and inversion of control
- Mature enterprise support and extensive community

**Starter Template:** Spring Initializr (start.spring.io)
- Spring Web for REST API
- Spring Data JPA for database access
- Spring Security for authentication and authorization
- Spring Mail (JavaMail API) for SMTP integration
- Springdoc OpenAPI for Swagger documentation
- PostgreSQL Driver
- Maven or Gradle for dependency management
