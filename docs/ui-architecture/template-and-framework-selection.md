# Template and Framework Selection

**Selected Framework:** Vite + React + TypeScript

**Rationale:**
This project is a web-based Employee Lifecycle Management System requiring rich interactive UI components (drag-and-drop workflow designer, real-time dashboards, complex forms with conditional logic), role-based access control, and responsive design for desktop and tablet devices.

**Why Vite + React + TypeScript:**
- **Vite:** Modern build tool with lightning-fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement), optimized development experience, and efficient production builds
- **React:** Mature ecosystem with excellent libraries for drag-and-drop (dnd-kit), form handling (React Hook Form), real-time data (React Query), and rich component libraries (Material-UI, Ant Design)
- **TypeScript:** Type safety critical for complex workflow logic, task orchestration, and role-based permissions; reduces runtime errors and improves developer experience

**Alternative Considerations:**
- Next.js was considered but SSR/SEO not required for internal enterprise tool
- Vue.js was considered but React has stronger enterprise tooling ecosystem for required features
- Create React App was considered but Vite offers superior build performance

**Starter Template:** None - building from Vite's official React-TypeScript template (`npm create vite@latest`)
